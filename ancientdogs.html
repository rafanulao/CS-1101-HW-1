            The carvings shown in the image above come from the rock-art sites of Shiwayamis and Jubbah in Saudi Arabia. The carvings depict the dogs with pricked ears, short snouts, and curled tails, showing distinctions from their wolf ancestors. The dogs are shown helping humans hunt various animals. These engravings are also the oldest archaeological evidence of dog leashes, suggesting that humans trained and controlled dogs well before settling down into farming communities.
